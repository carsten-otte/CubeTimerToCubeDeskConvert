# CubeTimerToCubeDeskConvert
Little python script written with the help of Google Gemini, that converts times from CubeTimer Android App to CubeDesk txt file.

Note that this only works with 3x3 solves, as those are the only ones I cared about converting. I manually removed other solve types from my csv in a text editor before converting. Usage see/edit at the bottom of the file.

Kudos to the Google AI team, great tool :-)
